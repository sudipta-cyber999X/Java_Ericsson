#SESSION-1

-> We would be learning about all the pre defined classes under java.io package
-> iostream, file iostream, file handling all are correct but file handling deals only with file input/
output not the keyboard & console.
-> not only performs file input / output or reading and writing from keyboard and display to console 

-> IOSTREAMS chapter -> providing API means predefined classes for storing data inside a file & reading
data from a file. 

What is the need of this chapter ? 
-> Learn how to store data permanently inside a file, how to read peramanent data from a file.

Diagram: 

                                                 IOSTREAMS
[keyboard] ----(System.in), reading ---->   {predefined classes} ------(store)-----> File (abc.txt)
[Console] <----(System.out), Writing-----   {predefined classes} <-----(reading)---- File (abc.txt)
          <----(System.err)--------------

#SESSION-2
Need of IO Streams ?
-> For storing data permanently in HDD. e.g., take the example of Banking System! 
-> If everything is stored in RAM and take the example of acct opening pay 10k and if we restart the system
it becomes 0. Is that feasible ? 
But, for information: we don't use IO Stream in the Banking System due to security issues. We store 
Business values rather in database concept. 
To interact with the database we are using JDBC API i.e., store data in database permanently. 

#SESSION-3 
Streams and Types of Streams:
-> What is a Stream ? 
-> A Stream is a logical connection between JAVA Program and a File through which we can transfer data
either for storing or for reading. 
Can we see the connection ? No it's not a Physical Connection.
