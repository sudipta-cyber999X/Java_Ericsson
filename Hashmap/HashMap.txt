#HASHMAP
-> is a DS that stores data in the form of ( Key <-> Value ) pair mapping.

#Frequency Mapping: 
Pens - 100
Pencils - 200
Notebooks - 20
It's a Count Map

-> Incase of Hashmap for the processes like
Searching, Insertion, Deletion, Contains
the time-complexity is O(1). 

# HASHMAP HIERARCHY:
Map-interface -> Hashmap, LinkedHashMap, SortedMap -> TreeMap
