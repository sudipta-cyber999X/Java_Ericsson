## FOR LOOP:

for (initialisation; condition; updation) {
    //Code 
}

-> we take a counter variable 
-> int counter = 0;  
-> counter = counter + 1
-> Terminating condition: counter < 100; 
-> print statement in between the curly braces { } of the for loop.

-> For infinite loop: Don't add any termination Condition!

## WHILE LOOP: 

while (condition) {
    // Do Something
}

## DO-WHILE LOOP

do {
    // Code
} while(condition);

-> do-while loop doesn't check the condition for the first time only. 
-> and remember to add the "terminator" after while in do-while loop.
