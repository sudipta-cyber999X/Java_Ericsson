## SORTING

In Arrays in JAVA we have an inbuilt function for sorting the elements in Array. 
In Recursion we would be learning Sorting using BACKTRACKING.

#1. BUBBLE SORT 
7 8 3 1 2
-> In bubble Sort we push the Heaviest element to the last. Then 2nd most heaviest element to the 2nd last.
till it gets sorted in Ascending Order. Similarly by reversing the Condition we can do it in descending 
order.
-> It runs loops for the (n - 1) times!.
-> We would compare the adjacent elements. 

#2. SELECTION SORT
