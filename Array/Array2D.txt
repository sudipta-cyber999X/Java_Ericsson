## Array 2D 
-> It would be useful for future complex problems or say in Dynamic Programming!
-> Tabulations like problems

2D Array -> Matrix studied in Matehmatics
that contains rows and columns. and had specific numbering
Cell -> (rows, cols): To find location of the element
The numbering begins with (0, 0) -> as JAVA language follows 0-based indexing.
-> (3 X 5) -> rows = 3 & columns = 5
  | 0| 1| 2| 3| 4|
 0|  |  |  |  |  |
 1|  |  |  |  |  |
 2|  |  |  |  |  |

Memory Consumption in 2D-Array:
=> (rows * columns) * dataTypeSize
In this case, 3*5*4 = 60 bytes

## 2D-ARRAY DECLARATION:

type[][] arrayName = new type[rows][columns];

e.g.,
int[][] numbers = new int[3][5]; 
=> numbers is the MATRIX here with rows = 3 and cols = 5;
