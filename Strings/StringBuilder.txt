## STRING BUILDER

As we've learned in the last class that String is immutable. That is, if you've created a String in the
memory one time, you can't add, delete anything.
To do the updation operations we need to create new String. 
The process to create a new String is a bit time-taking. 
So, to solve this problem, we've created a new class i.e., String Builder. 

## STRING IS IMMUTABLE 
-> Datas in JAVA are stored in the form of STACK (placing Objects one above the another) in Memory and some
part of the code is stored in Heap. 
e.g.,
    String str = "h";
-> "h" is stored in the HEAP; "str" is stored in STACK 
-> "str" would be pointing towards "h"

## FUNCTIONS

1. setCharAt(int index, char) 

2. insert(int index, char)

3. Delete substring
-> .delete(start index, end index); // Here the End Index is non-inclusive
-> e.g.,
sb.delete(2, 3); -> i.e., only index-2 will get deleted!

4. append -> add in the last position
-> sb.append('o')

5. sb.length();
